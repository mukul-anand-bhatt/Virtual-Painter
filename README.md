# Virtual-Painter
Virtual Painter for teachers to teach online without requirement of any external peripherals. 


Motivation -
 As we have seen in recent times, weather condition of areas like Delhi, Gurugram and Noida have
 deteriorated. Due to this sudden change in the weather condition, the schools have switched to online mode
 and this becomes a challenging situation for the teachers to teach online, as they do not have required
 peripherals (graphic tablet) and even if they are equipped with proper technology, it becomes a challenging
 task for them to use it efficiently. So, keeping this problem in mind, we have come up with a solution in which
 a teacher do not have to worry about the peripherals, they just need a simple pen to write anything in thin air.
